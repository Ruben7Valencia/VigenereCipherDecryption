Ruben Valencia - Vigenere Cipher Decryption  
Project General Description:

The Vigenere Cipher is a classic encryption algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt messages. This program implements the Vigenere Cipher to secure communication by encrypting and decrypting messages. In this program, the user is prompted to enter a message and key, and the result is displayed on the screen. The program uses algorithms based on mathematical concepts, such as modular arithmetic and polyalphabetic substitution, to implement the Vigenere Cipher.

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Start the program
2. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt
3. Enter the key you want to use
4. Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt by pressing 1 or 2
5. The result of your choice will be displayed on the screen

Please note that the program only supports uppercase alphabets of the English language, and the key length is limited by the size of the message. Also, the program does not support file input/output.
